<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[0, 5, 0]} fov={85}>
what is makeDefault?


X. add movement
X. add loading (will need to have all models separately tracked, and loaded at the end)
3. add throne room
X. add scrolling 
X. add scroll from place 1 to place 2
X. add scroll to rotate crown
7. import the low poly model things  
8. add transition from crown into screen 2 

im so uncreative i start every one with add 

- crown falls slow at first, then faster (ease in)
- 


- scroll to rotate crown: 
  - first model of crown: have text on back "mercedjam 2025"
  - unload first model and load second model
  - second model of crown: have text on front, "36 hours. make a game"
  - rotate, then zoom in into a new scene  

scroll
- useScrollCamera hook 
  - this hook manages the scroll amount and changes stuff accordingly (camera position, rotation)
  - this hook also takes in props like camera, crown
- inside of threescene: 
  - put camera and crown inside of useRef - this way, i can change camera and crown 
  - (important!!) cameraRef and crownRef are the props that are passed into the hook
  - inside camera and crown, there is a forwardRef exposes internal Three.js properties to ThreeScene
