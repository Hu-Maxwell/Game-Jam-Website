useMemo?
forwardRef? 

<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[0, 5, 0]} fov={85}>
what is makeDefault?


X. add movement
X. add loading (will need to have all models separately tracked, and loaded at the end)
3. add throne room
4. add scrolling 



scroll
- useScrollCamera hook 
  - this hook manages the scroll amount and changes stuff accordingly (camera position, rotation)
  - this hook also takes in props like camera, crown
- inside of threescene: 
  - put camera and crown inside of useRef - this way, i can change camera and crown 
  - (important!!) cameraRef and crownRef are the props that are passed into the hook
  - inside camera and crown, there is a forwardRef exposes internal Three.js properties to ThreeScene
