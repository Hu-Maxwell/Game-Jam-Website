idea: 

- cat sitting on the left
- scroll on the right, laying flat, on table
- 



X. create the textbox, should be on the center of the page 

X. create buttons below scroll

X. make textbox change question when back / next clicked
- link whatevers at the textbox later

4. make function for scroll to open / close whenever submit or back is clicked 

5. create animation for textbox 

6. style everything

7. create background

8. add assets

X. component name "Question" is stupid. change it to scroll or scrollInput or something

X. The glob option "as" has been deprecated in favour of "query". Please update `as: 'url'` to `query: '?url', import: 'default'`.
